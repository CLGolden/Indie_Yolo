    <h3>Program Schedule</h3>
    <p>
      This is a six-month program because that's how long it takes to develop a
      website and begin to get some traction on Google - provided a number of
      things are done right.
    </p>

    <p class="steps">
      <strong>The first month</strong> is about setting up a website. Besides
      being informative and attractive to potential customers, it needs to be
      mobile-friendly, accessible and optimized for search engines.
    </p>

    <p class="steps">
      <strong>The next couple weeks</strong> is about setting up the tools
      needed to be seen on Google Maps and in the search results. We'll also
      setup tools needed to monitor our success.
    </p>

    <p class="steps">
      <strong>The remaining 18 weeks</strong> are for posting weekly to Google
      My Business (GMB).
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the program is finished, you will know how to optimize and post your
      own photos for GMB and follow fundamental SEO practices. We will provide
      written and/or video tutorials for you or for anyone you hire to help in
      the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not an automated program like so many of the SEO/Marketing
      programs are. We will be hand-crafting the website and GMB posts and
      teaching you how to carry on after the program.
