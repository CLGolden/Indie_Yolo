      <h3>Website</h3>
      <p>
        We will be creating a
        <strong>small, static, 'brochure' website</strong> for the business. It
        will provide potential customers with business offerings and info,
        credentials and contact information.

        You'll want to
        <a href="https://www.domainit.com?a=f1e03919" target="_blank"
          >buy your own domain name</a
        ><sup>*</sup>
        (~$20 per year with Whois Privacy) and set up an email account specific
        to your business. We'll show you how.
      </p>

        <strong>Email accounts can start free</strong> with Google's Gmail or
        with ProtonMail. But, it's better for your business if you can purchase
        one that uses your business domain name.
