    <h3>Website</h3>
    <p>
      We will be creating a small, static, 'brochure' website for the business.
      It will provide potential customers with business offerings and info,
      credentials and contact information.

    <p>
      You'll want to buy your own domain name (~ $20 per year) and email hosting
      (from free to ~ $79 per 2 years ) with ProtonMail Plus).
    </p>
    <p>This program includes free web hosting (normally ~ $240 per year).</p>
