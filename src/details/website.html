    <h3>Website</h3>
    <p>
      We will be creating a
      <strong>small, static, 'brochure' website</strong> for the business. It
      will provide potential customers with business offerings and info,
      credentials and contact information.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll want to
      <a href="https://www.domainit.com?a=f1e03919" target="_blank"
        >buy your own domain name</a
      >
      (~$20 per year with Whois Privacy) and
      <strong>set up an email account</strong> specific to your business. We'll
      show you how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Email accounts can start free with Google's Gmail or with ProtonMail. But,
      it's better for your business if you can purchase one that uses your
      business domain name.
    </p>
    <p>Cost ranges for business email accounts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>99Â¢/month/email (DomainIt)</li>
      <li>$6/month/email (Google)</li>
      <li>
        $79 for 2 years for 5 emails with
        <a
          href="https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/paid-plans/"
          target="_blank"
          >ProtonMail Plus</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This program includes free web hosting with a company called Netlify.
      Normally, web hosting costs ~$240 per year.
