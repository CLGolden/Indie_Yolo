title: "Can I update the website myself?"
---

There are many 'no-code' website solutions available now. Even so, they each have their own learning curve, and it's been my experience that busy business owners don't have the time or desire to learn them. So, they hire or assign someone to do it.

In addition, the 'no-code' website builders require you to use their hosting service and forbid you to take your work anywhere else. In other words, you are renting a website from them. After just the 2nd month of this program, you will own your website and all its content.

You'll need someone who knows HTML/CSS and other technical basics to make occasional updates to the site we're going to build. Many youngsters are learning how to code now; and it's important for them to do so! I will be training interns as 'Technical Assistants' to help graduates of this program at an affordable price.
