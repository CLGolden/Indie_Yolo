## Program Details

### Website

We will be creating a small, static, 'brochure' website for your business. This is essentially a digital business card. It will provide potential customers with your offerings and business info, credentials and contact information.

### Google Tools Setup

There are a set of free tools that Google provides for Local Businesses. Once the website is done, I'll set up the following:

- Google My Business (GMB) so your business will show up in search results and on Google - Maps
- Google Analytics (GA4) so we can monitor how many people are coming to your website
- Google Search Console so we can monitor how healthy your website is

### Continuing SEO

There are other basic principles you'll need to understand for practical, sustainable marketing. These include the use of keywords, image and link optimization. We'll also want to get you setup in business directories such as Yelp and Yellow Pages. You'll also need to monitor what people have to say about your business and learn how to respond to negative reviews.

### Support & Tutorials

You'll be learning a lot during the initial website setup. After that will be opportunity to learn and get support during our weekly updates where you provide photos and descriptions.
