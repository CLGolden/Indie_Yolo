    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What will my website look like?</summary>
      <p>
        Since this is a beginners program, we assume you'll need help with
        colors and a logo. Together, we'll come up with an attractive color
        palette and text logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The layout of the site will be based on clear and simple,
        well-researched principles of good user-experience. This program offers
        a website that is one step up from Google's automatic, highly limited
        website.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Will I be able to update the website myself?</summary>
      <p>
        We will be building a 'static' website. This means that occasional
        updates like hours, testimonials, staff-changes and the like will need
        to be done by someone who knows HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be available to make those changes at a highly reduced rate–and
        will teach you how to find and hire a qualified 'Technical Assistant' on
        your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, we will be offering paid apprenticehips to people who
        want to learn how to be a 'Technical Assistant.' They will receive
        on-the-job-training to help graduates of this program make updates at an
        affordable price.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Why won't we be using Facebook or Instagram?</summary>
      <p>
        In this program, we will not be using any of the Facebook social media
        products. The most practical reason is that social media is for
        socializing, so it's harder to make sales with that audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we will be using Google My Business (GMB) and fundamental
        Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques. This approach reaches an
        audience who is more <em>ready to buy</em> your product or service.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What would this program cost on the open market?</summary>
      <p>
        The retail, for-profit cost of this 6-month program would be around
        $3000.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How much traffic will my website get?</summary>
      <p>
        As you can imagine, it's impossible to promise an exact number. We can
        guantee it will be more than zero. Improvement in Google Search is
        cumulative–once it begins, it snowballs. So the sooner you get started,
        the better.
      </p>
      <p></p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I sponsor a local business?</summary>
      <p>
        Are you in a position to help a local business get off the ground? You
        can purchase this program–at a reduced rate–for them as a sponsor. Go to
        <a href="/donate/">our Donate page</a> for details.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>
        Can I purchase the program at the retail rate of $3,000?
      </summary>
      <p>
        Yes! Paying the retail price for this program will get your marketing
        off to a great start–and will help sponsor others.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What if a competitor wants the program?</summary>
      <p>
        We will not accept a new business that directly competes with an
        existing program member without your explicit consent.
