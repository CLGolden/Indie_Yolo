    <h2>Program Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is a very specific program designed for small, local business owners
      just beginning to do online marketing. It consists of...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The development of a simple, static website</li>
      <li>Getting established on Google Search and Maps</li>
      <li>Education and mentoring on marketing basics and internet safety</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who this Program is For</h3>

      <div>
        <h4>Local Businesses</h4>
        <p>
          If you have a product or service that is only available for customers
          in or around Yolo County, CA, your business is considered to be a
          'Local Business.'
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Minority Business Owners</h4>
        <p>
          This program is for "Minority" business owners which include people of
          color, indiginous or Asian people, and women, especially single moms.
        </p>

        <h4>Willingness to Learn</h4>
        <p>
          This is a beginners program. Business owners will be given the

    <h3>Who this Program is Not For</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>E-commerce or online shopping websites</li>
      <li>Businesses that are based on blogging, memberships or events</li>
      <li>Businesses that need to make frequent updates to the website</li>
      <li>
        Anyone who wants to 'game' the system. This program is based on success
        through good quality products and community-first business dealings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone who wants to 'get rich quick.' Sustainable success takes steady
        efforts over time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Business Owner's Commitment</h3>

    <p>
      In order to be the business that people think of when they are (finally!)
      ready to buy, small businesses will have had to be on the public's mind
      continuously for some time beforehand. That means the business owner needs
      to provide consistent, attractive, believable advertising all the time. It
      doesn't have to be elaborate! But it does need to be original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, business owners can do this advertising for free, if you are
      willing to develop some new habits.
    </p>

    <h3>Marketing Habits for Local Business Owners</h3>
    <p>For this program you'll need to be willing to do the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Take a 1-2 photos of your work, your place of business (if applicable)
        and/or your - people every week.
      </li>
      <li>Text or email the photos to me along with a brief description.</li>
      <li>
        Get into the habit of asking customers for Google reviews or
        testimonials.
      </li>
      <li>Be willing to learn the basics of internet safety and marketing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Program Schedule</h3>
    <p>
      This is a six-month program because that's how long it takes to develop
      'authority' on Google–provided a number of things are done right.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>1 </span>The first month is about setting up a website. Besides
      being informative and attractive to potential customers, it needs to be
      mobile-friendly, accessible and optimized for search engines.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>2 </span>The next couple weeks is about setting up the tools needed
      to be seen on Google Maps and in the search results. We'll also setup
      tools needed to monitor our success.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>3 </span>The remaining 18 weeks are for posting weekly to Google My
      Business (GMB).
    </p>

    <p>
      Please Note: In this program, we will not be using any of the Facebook
      social media products. There are several good reasons for this, which I
      describe below. Instead, we will be using Google My Business (GMB) and
      fundamental Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques. This approach
      reaches a more general audience–an audience who is more ready to buy your
      product or service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the program is finished, you will know how to optimize and post your
      own photos for GMB and follow critical SEO practice. I will provide
      written and/or video tutorials for your or anyone you hire to help in the
      future.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not an automated program like so many of the SEO/Marketing
      programs are. I will be hand-crafting the website and GMB posts and
      teaching you how to carry on after the program.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>What will my website look like?</summary>
      <p>
        Based on the principles of BMSU. If you confuse, you lose. Colors,
        Letter logo Since this is a beginners program...
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Will I be able to update the website myself?</summary>

      <p>
        We will be building a static website. Occasional updates like hours,
        testimonials, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many 'no-code' website solutions available now. Even so, they
        each have their own learning curve, and it's been my experience that
        busy business owners don't have the time or desire to learn them. So,
        they hire or assign someone to do it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, the 'no-code' website builders require you to use their
        hosting service and forbid you to take your work anywhere else. In other
        words, you are renting a website from them. After just the 2nd month of
        this program, you will own your website and all its content.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll need someone who knows HTML/CSS and other technical basics to
        make occasional updates to the site we're going to build. Many
        youngsters are learning how to code now; and it's important for them to
        do so! I will be training interns as 'Technical Assistants' to help
        graduates of this program at an affordable price.
      </p>
