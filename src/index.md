## A Six-Month Marketing Program for Minority-Owned, Yolo County Businesses

Current Grants Available: 4

I'm a retired, local web developer who wants to contribute to the community - while continuing to do what I love: writing code and empowering independent people.

I'm offering a very specific, online marketing program based on the fundamentals of 'Local Business' development: a website and a solid presence on Google.

After 10 years helping small businesses with their websites and marketing, I've come to realize there is a small, but crucial, set of principles and actions a business owner must learn and employ if they want a practical, sustainable marketing foundation. This program is designed to educate, setup and support qualified, independent business owners.

_Local Business Marketing Program_ is a non-profit organization. Local business owners need to apply for a grant. If you want to sponsor a recipient, please go to our Sponsor's page to learn more and donate.

### Who this Program is For

If you have a product or service that is only available for customers in or around Yolo County, CA, your business is considered to be a 'Local Business.' People can come to your shop or you go to them. Examples are businesses like seamstresses, bakeries, small growers, professionals or local construction contractors.

"Minority" business owners include people of color, indiginous or Asian people, and women, especially single moms.

### Who this Program is _Not_ For

This program is not meant for

- ecommerce sites
- blogging or membership sites
- online events
- any business model that requires frequent updates to the website
  It's also not for people who want to 'get rich quick' or make a million dollars. The objective of this program is to teach small business owners marketing habits that will produce a steady, sustainable income.

## Program Description

This is a six-month program because that's how long it takes to develop 'authority' on Google. The first month is about setting up a website. The next couple weeks is about setting up the tools needed to monitor success on Google. The remaining weeks 18 weeks are for posting weekly to Google My Business (GMB).

I'll describe each of these parts in more detail below, but first, let's consider the habits a small business owner needs to develop and commit to.

### Marketing Habits for Local Business Owners

In order to be the business that people think of when they are (finally!) ready to buy, small businesses will have had to be on the public's mind continuously for some time beforehand. That means you need to provide consistent, attractive, believable advertising. It doesn't have to be elaborate! But it does need to be original.

Fortunately, business owners can do this advertising for free, if you are willing to develop some basic habits. For this program you'll need to be willing to do the following:

- Take weekly photos of your work, your place of business (if applicable) and/or your - people.
- Text or email the photos with a brief description to me.
- Get into the habit of asking customers for Google reviews or testimonials.
- Be willing to learn the basics of internet safety and marketing.
  **Please Note: In this program, we will not be using any of the Facebook social media products.** There are several good reasons for this, which I describe elsewhere. Instead, we will be using Google My Business (GMB) and fundamental Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques. This approach reaches a more general audienceâ€“an audience who is more ready to buy your product or service.

Once the program is finished, you will know how to optimize and post your own photos for GMB and follow critical SEO practice. I will provide written and/or video tutorials for your or anyone you hire to help in the future.

This is not an automated program like so many of the SEO/Marketing programs are. I will be hand-crafting the website and GMB posts and teaching you how to carry on after the program.

## Program Details

### Website

We will be creating a small, static, 'brochure' website for your business. This is essentially a digital business card. It will provide potential customers with your offerings and business info, credentials and contact information.

### Google Tools Setup

There are a set of free tools that Google provides for Local Businesses. Once the website is done, I'll set up the following:

- Google My Business (GMB) so your business will show up in search results and on Google - Maps
- Google Analytics (GA4) so we can monitor how many people are coming to your website
- Google Search Console so we can monitor how healthy your website is

### Continuing SEO

There are other basic principles you'll need to understand for practical, sustainable marketing. These include the use of keywords, image and link optimization. We'll also want to get you setup in business directories such as Yelp and Yellow Pages. You'll also need to monitor what people have to say about your business and learn how to respond to negative reviews.

### Support & Tutorials

You'll be learning a lot during the initial website setup. After that will be opportunity to learn and get support during our weekly updates where you provide photos and descriptions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>Will I be able to update my website?</summary>
<p>There are many 'no-code' website solutions available now. Even so,
they each have their own learning curve, and it's been my
experience that busy business owners don't have the time or desire
to learn them. So, they hire or assign someone to do it.</p>
<p>In addition, the 'no-code' website builders require you to use their hosting service and forbid you to take your work anywhere else. In other words, you are renting a website from them. After just the 2nd month of this program, you will own your website and all its content.</p>
<p>You'll need someone who knows HTML/CSS and other technical basics to make occasional updates to the site we're going to build. Many youngsters are learning how
to code now; and it's important for them to do so! I will be training interns as 'Technical Assistants' to help graduates of this program at an affordable price.</p>
