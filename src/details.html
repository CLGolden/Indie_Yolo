  <h2>Program Details</h2>
  <p>
    This page is for developing the program, a whitepaper of sorts, for
    supporters and sponsors and may not be part of the final website.
  </p>

  <h3>Website</h3>
  <p>
    We will be creating a small, static, 'brochure' website for the business. It
    will provide potential customers with business offerings and info,
    credentials and contact information.
  </p>
  <p>Formula based on Marketing Made Simple</p>

  <h3>Google Products & Tools</h3>

  <p>
    There are a set of free tools that Google provides for Local Businesses.
    Once the website is done, I'll set up the following:
  </p>
  <p>Google Analytics is now GA4 which is what we'll be using.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Google My Business (GMB) so your business will show up in search results
      and on Google - Maps
    </li>
    <li>
      Google Analytics (GA4) so we can monitor how many people are coming to
      your website
    </li>
    <li>Google Search Console so we can monitor how healthy your website is</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Continuing SEO</h3>
  <p>
    Weekly posts to GMB. Setup in Yelp, other search engines... Focus on 5-10
    keywords... Image and link optimization... Canva for images. Monitoring and
    respnding to customer reviews.
  </p>

  <h3>Education & Support</h3>
  <p>
    You'll be learning a lot during the initial website setup. After that you'll
    have the opportunity to learn and get support during our weekly updates
    where you provide photos and descriptions. Provided with video and written
    tutorials, both general and specific to your program.
