    <p>
      In order to be the business that people think of when they are (finally!)
      ready to buy, small businesses will have had to be on the public's mind
      continuously for some time beforehand. That means the business owner needs
      to provide consistent, attractive, believable advertising all the time. It
      doesn't have to be elaborate! But it does need to be original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, business owners can do this advertising for free, if you are
      willing to develop some new habits.
