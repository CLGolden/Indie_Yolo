        In order to be the business that people think of when they are
        (finally!) ready to buy, small businesses will have had to be on the
        public's mind continuously for some time beforehand. That means the
        business owner needs to provide consistent, attractive, believable
        advertising all the time.

        are willing to develop some new habits.
