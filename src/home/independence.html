    <h2>Choosing Independence</h2>
    <p>
      It's more important than ever for people to have choices about how they
      make a living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trading goods and services with our neighbors is as old as human
      civilization, and something any person should be able to fall back on when
      'having a job' isn't possible or sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, getting the word out to your 'neighborhood' takes specialized
      knowledge - of the internet, websites, SEO, Google and more. The people
      who have the knowledge are pricing their services for business that are
      operating in the middle and higher tiers of income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those businesses invariably had help; maybe in the form of money or maybe
      just in the form of business knowlege and support. This program is
      offering all three.
