    <h2>Choosing Independence</h2>
    <p>
      It's more important than ever for people to have choices about how they
      make a living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trading goods and services with our neighbors is as old as human
      civilization, and something any person should be able to fall back on when
      'having a job' isn't possible or sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've figured out what your product or service is, you need to let
      the community know it's available.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days, getting the word out to your 'neighborhood' is free, but it
      takes specialized knowledge - of the internet, websites, SEO, Google Maps
      and more. The people who have the knowledge are pricing their services for
      business that are operating in the middle and higher tiers of income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those higher-tiered business-owners invariably had help; maybe in the form
      of money or maybe just in the form of business knowlege and social
      support. This program aspires to offer all three to people who would
      choose independence, but have been systematically denied access to these
      kinds of resourses for generations.
