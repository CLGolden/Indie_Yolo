## Program Overview

I'm offering a very specific, online marketing program based on the fundamentals of 'Local Business' development: a website and a solid presence on Google.

After 10 years helping small businesses with their websites and marketing, I've come to realize there is a small, but crucial, set of principles and actions a business owner must learn and employ if they want a practical, sustainable marketing foundation. This program is designed to educate, setup and support qualified, independent business owners.

_Local Business Marketing Program_ is a non-profit organization. Local business owners need to apply for a grant. If you want to sponsor a recipient, please go to our Sponsor's page to learn more and donate.

This is a six-month program because that's how long it takes to develop 'authority' on Google. The first month is about setting up a website. The next couple weeks is about setting up the tools needed to monitor success on Google. The remaining weeks 18 weeks are for posting weekly to Google My Business (GMB).

I'll describe each of these parts in more detail below, but first, let's consider the habits a small business owner needs to develop and commit to.
