## Program Overview

### Who this Program is For

#### Local Businesses, New or Existing

If you have a product or service that is only available for customers in or around Yolo County, CA, your business is considered to be a 'Local Business.'

People can come to your shop or you go to them. Examples are businesses like seamstresses, bakeries, small growers, dentists, landscapers or local construction contractors.

Even if you are a one-person product or service provider, you are a Local Business. This program would be ideal for you.

#### Minority Business Owners

This program is for "Minority" business owners which include people of color, indiginous or Asian people, and women, especially single moms.

#### Business Owners with a Desire to Learn

This is a mentorship program that provides the fundamentals of internet safety and marketing so that you can take over with confidence.

### Who this Program is _Not_ For

- E-commerce or online shopping websites
- Businesses that are based on blogging, memberships or events
- Businesses that need to make frequent updates to the website
- Anyone who wants to 'game' the system. This program is based on success through good quality products, honest business dealings.
- Anyone who wants to 'get rich quick.' Sustainable, practical success takes steady efforts over time.

### What's included

There is a small, but crucial, set of principles and actions a business owner must learn and employ if they want a practical, sustainable marketing foundation. This program is designed to provide the education and setup to accomplish that.

This is a six-month program because that's how long it takes to develop 'authority' on Google.

- The first month is about setting up a website.
- The next couple weeks is about setting up the tools needed to monitor success on Google.
- The remaining weeks 18 weeks are for posting weekly to Google My Business (GMB).
