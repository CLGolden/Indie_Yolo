    <h2>Program Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is a very specific program designed for small, local business owners
      who want to...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>get their online marketing off to a solid start,</li>
      <li>learn a small set of highly efficient marketing habits,</li>
      <li>and learn how to expand their marketing with confidence.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The program includes a simple, custom website, the setup and actions
      needed for your business to show up on Google Maps and Search, and
      training and coaching so you can take over or hire the right person to
      take over.
    </p>
    <h2>Choosing Independence</h2>
    <p>
      It's more important than ever for anyone to have choices about how they
      make a living. Normally, a program like this would cost $3,000. As a
      non-profit organization, our goal is to provide this program for free to
      minority and single-mom business owners.
