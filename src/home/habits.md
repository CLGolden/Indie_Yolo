### Marketing Habits for Local Business Owners

In order to be the business that people think of when they are (finally!) ready to buy, small businesses will have had to be on the public's mind continuously for some time beforehand. That means you need to provide consistent, attractive, believable advertising. It doesn't have to be elaborate! But it does need to be original.

Fortunately, business owners can do this advertising for free, if you are willing to develop some basic habits. For this program you'll need to be willing to do the following:

- Take weekly photos of your work, your place of business (if applicable) and/or your - people.
- Text or email the photos with a brief description to me.
- Get into the habit of asking customers for Google reviews or testimonials.
- Be willing to learn the basics of internet safety and marketing.
  **Please Note: In this program, we will not be using any of the Facebook social media products.** There are several good reasons for this, which I describe elsewhere. Instead, we will be using Google My Business (GMB) and fundamental Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques. This approach reaches a more general audienceâ€“an audience who is more ready to buy your product or service.

Once the program is finished, you will know how to optimize and post your own photos for GMB and follow critical SEO practice. I will provide written and/or video tutorials for your or anyone you hire to help in the future.

This is not an automated program like so many of the SEO/Marketing programs are. I will be hand-crafting the website and GMB posts and teaching you how to carry on after the program.
