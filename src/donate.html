  <h2>There are two ways to donate</h2>

  <h3>Sponsor a Local, Minority-Owned Business</h3>
  <p>
    Are you in a position to sponsor a local, minority business owner's
    marketing success? "Minority" includes people of color, indiginous or Asian
    people, and women, especially single moms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Have the business owner fill in the
    <a href="/contact/#grantApp">Grant Application</a> checking the box that
    asks if they have a sponsor.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the second step of the process, we'll ask the candidate for your contact
    info and coordinate with you on progress updates and payment schedule.
  </p>

  <p>
    This 6-month program retails for $3,000. Since, as a non-profit, we don't
    have to pay federal taxes, we offer it for $2,520. Payments can be made
    monthly ($ 420) and can be discontinued if the student quits the program
    early.
  </p>

  <h3>General Donation</h3>

  <p>
    You can make a general donation to this program by credit card. Program
    income and expense statements are available on our
    <a href="/documents/">Documents page</a>.
