    <h3>Sponsor a Local, Small Business</h3>
    <p>
      Are you in a position to sponsor a local, woman- or minority-owned
      business owner's marketing success? "Minority" includes people of color,
      Indigenous or Asian people, and women, especially single moms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Have the business owner fill in the
      <a href="/contact/#application">Application</a> checking the box that asks
      if they have a sponsor.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the second step of the process, we'll ask the candidate for your
      contact info and coordinate with you on progress updates and payment
      schedule.
    </p>

    <p>
      This 6-month program retails for $3,000. As a non-profit,
      <strong>we can offer the program for $1,800</strong>. Payments can be made
      monthly ($ 300) and can be discontinued if the recipient quits the program
      early.
