          <p>
            I'm a retired, local web developer who wants to contribute to the
            community - while continuing to do what I love: writing code and
            empowering independent people.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm offering a very specific, online marketing program based on the
            fundamentals of 'Local Business' development: a website and a solid
            presence on Google.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 10 years helping small businesses with their websites and
            marketing, I've come to realize there is a small, but crucial, set
            of principles and actions a business owner must learn and employ if
            they want a practical, sustainable marketing foundation. This
            program is designed to educate, setup and support qualified,
            independent business owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Local Business Marketing Program</strong> is a non-profit
            organization. Local business owners need to apply for a grant. If
            you want to sponsor a recipient, please go to our Sponsor's page to
            learn more and donate.
          </p>
          <h3>Who this Program is For</h3>
          <p>
            If you have a product or service that is only available for
            customers in or around Yolo County, CA, your business is considered
            to be a 'Local Business.' People can come to your shop or you go to
            them. Examples are businesses like seamstresses, bakeries, small
            growers, professionals or local construction contractors.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Minority" business owners include people of color, indiginous or
            Asian people, and women, especially single moms.
          </p>
          <h3>Who this Program is Not For</h3>
          <p>This program is not meant for</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ecommerce sites</li>
            <li>blogging or membership sites</li>
            <li>online events</li>
            <li>
              any business model that requires frequent updates to the website
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's also not for people who want to 'get rich quick' or make a
            million dollars. The objective of this program is to teach small
            business owners marketing habits that will produce a steady,
            sustainable income.

          <h2>Program Description</h2>
          <p>
            This is a six-month program because that's how long it takes to
            develop 'authority' on Google. The first month is about setting up a
            website. The next couple weeks is about setting up the tools needed
            to monitor success on Google. The remaining weeks 18 weeks are for
            posting weekly to Google My Business (GMB).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll describe each of these parts in more detail below, but first,
            let's consider the habits a small business owner needs to develop
            and commit to.
          </p>

          <h3>Marketing Habits for Local Business Owners</h3>
          <p>
            In order to be the business that people think of when they are
            (finally!) ready to buy, small businesses will have had to be on the
            public's mind continuously for some time beforehand. That means you
            need to provide consistent, attractive, believable advertising.
            <strong>It doesn't have to be elaborate!</strong> But it does need
            to be original.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, business owners can do this advertising for free, if
            you are willing to develop some basic habits. For this program
            you'll need to be willing to do the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Take weekly photos of your work, your place of business (if
              applicable) and/or your people.
            </li>
            <li>Text or email the photos with a brief description to me.</li>
            <li>
              Get into the habit of asking customers for Google reviews or
              testimonials.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be willing to learn the basics of internet safety and marketing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please Note: In this program,
            <strong
              >we will not be using any of the Facebook social media
              products.</strong
            >
            There are several good reasons for this, which I describe elsewhere.
            Instead, we will be using Google My Business (GMB) and fundamental
            Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques. This approach reaches a
            more general audienceâ€“an audience who is more ready to buy your
            product or service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the program is finished, you will know how to optimize and post
            your own photos for GMB and follow critical SEO practice. I will
            provide written and/or video tutorials for your or anyone you hire
            to help in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not an automated program like so many of the SEO/Marketing
            programs are. I will be hand-crafting the website and GMB posts and
            teaching you how to carry on after the program.
          </p>
          <h3>Program Details</h3>
          <h4>Website</h4>
          <p>
            We will be creating a small, static, 'brochure' website for your
            business. This is essentially a digital business card. It will
            provide potential customers with your offerings and business info,
            credentials and contact information.
          </p>
          <h4>Google Tools Setup</h4>
          <p>
            There are a set of free tools that Google provides for Local
            Businesses. Once the website is done, I'll set up the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Google My Business (GMB) so your business will show up in search
              results and on Google Maps
            </li>
            <li>
              Google Analytics (GA4) so we can monitor how many people are
              coming to your website
            </li>
            <li>
              Google Search Console so we can monitor how healthy your website
              is
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Continuing SEO</h4>
          <p>
            There are other basic principles you'll need to understand for
            practical, sustainable marketing. These include the use of keywords,
            image and link optimization. We'll also want to get you setup in
            business directories such as Yelp and Yellow Pages. You'll also need
            to monitor what people have to say about your business and learn how
            to respond to negative reviews.
          </p>
          <h4>Support & Tutorials</h4>
          <p>
            You'll be learning a lot during the initial website setup. After
            that will be opportunity to learn and get support during our weekly
            updates where you provide photos and descriptions.

            <summary>Will I be able to update my website?</summary>
            <p>
              There are many 'no-code' website solutions available now. Even so,
              they each have their own learning curve, and it's been my
              experience that busy business owners don't have the time or desire
              to learn them. So, they hire or assign someone to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
              You'll need someone who knows HTML/CSS to make occasional updates
              to the site we're going to build. Many youngsters are learning how
              to code now; and it's important for them to do so! I will be
              training interns to help with this at an affordable price.
